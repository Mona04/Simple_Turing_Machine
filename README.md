# Simple-Turing-Machine

To study "Computability and Logic" by George S. Boolos, turing machine simulator is needed.

you just edit turing.txt.

Uploaded txt file is my solution of the example of the book.
If you want to use other txt file, just rename turing.txt

turing.txt is composed of 5 int and char.

(function state) (when 0 what to do) (when 0 where to go function state) (when 1 what to do) (when 1 where to go function state)

function state is int from 0. 
For what to do, There are 4 choices.  0(erase tape), 1(stroke tape), R(go Right), L(go Left).
